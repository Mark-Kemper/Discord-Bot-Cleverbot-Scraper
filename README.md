# Discord-Bot-Cleverbot-Scraper
This discord bot web-scrapes responses from cleverbot.com, which is a website offering a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, to respond to users in a different way than  typical scripted bot responses. Other features include reacting to a message with an emoji-fied version of that message if there are no repeat letters.

Notes:
1. The bot is hosted for free on replit.com, and pinged through the free service uptimerobot.com which allows it to continue running through the nodejs module Express.
2. A Node.js replit was not used because it only allows the installation of packages that are in the Node Package Manager, which does not include some of the dependencies of the headless browser binary, so a Bash replit was used and Node.js was installed with the "install-pkg nodejs" command.
